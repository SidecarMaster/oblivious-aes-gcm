# MobileCoin: Oblivious AES-GCM

WARNING: You should use the [`aes-gcm`](https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs) crate, not this one. This crate is a patch/fork of the execellent RustCrypto crate to support a very, very niche use-case for MobileCoin, and as such it's maintenance and security are necessarily going to lag behind that of RustCrypto's crate.
